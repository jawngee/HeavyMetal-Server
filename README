HeavyMetal Server
=================
JavaScript application server written in Cocoa.  

Mostly to test out ideas.  Obviously, not even remotely usable for a production scenario.

Usage
=====
Download.  Compile.  Run.

Make sure to setup the application path in the preferences.  This should point to the 
jssites folder in this project.  Restart the server.

Once done with that, navigate to http://localhost:8181/

Dependencies
============
LibYAML - http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.1.3.tar.gz
(Download, ./configure, make, make install)
